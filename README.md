# Bitcoin Kernel Benchmarking Tool [WIP]

Bitcoin Kernel is a feature introduced in Bitcoin Core see PR [#30595](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30595) which exposes C API of consensus engine or basically validation logic of bitcoin-core to be used by external applications. This tool benchmarks validation logic vs direct internal kernel interfaces.
